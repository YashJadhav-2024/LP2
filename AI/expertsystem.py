# main()
# Main function of the program. Contains complete employee evaluation logic.

# print()
# Used to display output on the screen.

# input()
# Used to take input from the user.

# strip()
# Removes extra spaces from beginning and end of input.

# int()
# Converts string input into integer.

# lower()
# Converts text into lowercase.

# if / elif / else
# Used for decision making based on conditions.

# Boolean Variables (True / False)
# Used as flags to track conditions like high_performer or critical_issue.

# Comparison Operators
# >=  Greater than or equal to
# <=  Less than or equal to
# ==  Equal to
# !=  Not equal to
# >   Greater than
# <   Less than

# Logical Operators
# and -> Both conditions must be true
# or  -> At least one condition must be true
# not -> Reverses the condition

# Example:
# if score >= 15 and not critical_issue:
# Means:
# score must be 15 or more
# AND
# critical_issue must be False

# += operator
# Adds value and stores result back into variable.
# Example:
# score += 2
# same as:
# score = score + 2

# __name__ == "__main__"
# Checks whether the file is executed directly.
# If true, main() function runs.

# Example:
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
